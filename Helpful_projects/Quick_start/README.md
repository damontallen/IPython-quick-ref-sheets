#### For Ubuntu 12.04 Users.

Download these files and run:

sudo sh Quick_install.sh *-- out of date, see Update*

It will install a bunch of packages that are often used in IPython and create
three shortcuts on your desktop.  You may want to edit the path in the IPython 
shorcuts to reflect the directory you want to store your notebooks in. 
Additionally, you will have to manually change the appearance of the icons of 
the shortcuts.  This is done by right clicking on the icon->properties->click on 
the current icon and slect a new one.  Two icons images are among the files 
here.

(Still needs work buts gets most of the big stuff.)

#### New Stuff:

The files:

* IPython_dir.py
* IPython3_dir.py

Will open up file dialog boxes which you can use to open IPython in a particular 
directory.  You will need to edit them to set your default path.

You still need to use Stop IPython Notebook.sh when you are done to close all of
the IPython processes.

#### Update: 

Quick_install.sh is now out of date with the release of IPython 1.1 but a lot of
the packages it installs still need to be installed.  My current procedure uses 
the following apt-get commands.  I am not sure all are necessary and some might 
be missing but I'm 95% sure...

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    sudo apt-get install python3.3
    sudo apt-get install pandoc g++
    sudo apt-get install python-pip python-zmq python-jinja2 python-pygments
    sudo pip install tornado

    sudo pip install sphinx # to get the latest version of sphinx for nbconvert

    sudo apt-get install curl python3-zmq python3-jinja2 python3-pygments python3-sphinx python3-setuptools

    sudo cp /usr/bin/pip /usr/local/bin/pip-2.7 # needed to not lose pip-2.7

    curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
    sudo python3.2 get-pip.py
    sudo pip-3.2 install tornado
    sudo pip-3.2 install sympy # optional for using sympy
    sudo easy_install -U distribute
    sudo apt-get install freetype* 
    sudo apt-get install python-dev
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev
    sudo apt-get install python3.2-dev
    sudo apt-get install numpy
    sudo pip-3.2 install --upgrade numpy
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:takluyver/python3
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
    sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib
    sudo pip-2.7 install --upgrade matplotlib
    sudo pip-3.2 install --upgrade matplotlib
    
    sudo apt-get install texlive # for nbconvert
    
    sudo apt-get install python-pyside # for my menu programs
    sudo apt-get install python3-pyside # for my menu programs
    
    sudo apt-get install mayavi2      # for a personal project
    sudo apt-get install python-scipy
    sudo apt-get install python3-scipy
    sudo apt-get install python-sympy
    sudo apt-get install python3-sympy # already installed above
    
    download the latest sympy from https://github.com/sympy/sympy/releases
    install it from sorce code via
    sudo python setup.py install
    sudo python3 setup.py install
    
I also downloaded the IPython source files and installed it with the two following commands:

    sudo python setup.py install
    sudo python3 setup.py install

However I guess I could have used these instead:

    sudo pip-2.7 install ipython
    sudo pip-3.2 install ipython # might not have installed IPython for Python3.3

I'm also not sure if these would have installed the IPython Notebook.

#### LaTex File Conversion

In order to use nbconvert to create a LaTex file or a LaTex pdf you will also need to install the following:

    sudo apt-get install texlive.base
    sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

#### Trouble Shooting

The easiest way to find out why something doesn't work is to run the command from the terminal 
and read the error messages to determine what packages are missing and/or what commands have 
errors in them.

### Final Note on Executing Scripts and Programs

In order to be able to run a script by clicking on it you will need to enable nautilus within dconfg-editor.
The followinf instructions were written by Basharat Sial [here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/138908/how-to-execute-a-script-just-by-double-clicking-like-exe-files-in-windows).

	Hit Alt+F2, type dconf-editor and hit Enter.
	In dconfg-editor goto: org ➤ gnome ➤ nautilus ➤ preferences
	Click on executable-text-activation and from drop down menu select:
	launch: to launch scripts as programs.
	OR
	ask: to ask what to do via a dialog.
	Close dconf-editor. Thats it!
